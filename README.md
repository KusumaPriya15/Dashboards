## Purpose:

The dashboard focuses on analyzing car sales data, with a particular emphasis on metrics like brand versus selling price, yearly trends in kilometers driven, and the total number of cars sold. The primary goal is to understand how different variables such as brand, year, fuel type, and ownership affect car sales and usage.

### Findings:

1. Brand vs. Selling Price:
   - Different brands have been compared based on their selling prices. This chart likely identifies which brands hold more value in the market and how pricing strategies differ across brands.
   - A grand total row suggests overall insights into the cumulative sales across all brands.

2. Year vs. Sum of Kilometers Driven:
   - This chart tracks how many kilometers cars have been driven each year. It might reveal trends in car usage over time, with possible implications for car longevity or market preferences.
   - The data shows varying kilometers driven across different years, indicating fluctuations in vehicle usage.

3. Year vs. Total Number of Cars Sold:
   - It tracks the total number of cars sold each year, offering insights into market trends, such as peak sales years and possible market downturns.
   - This could help in understanding how the car market has evolved over time.

4. Fuel Type Analysis:
   - Several sheets compare fuel types against variables like kilometers driven and the number of owners, offering insights into consumer preferences for different fuel types and how these preferences may correlate with car usage and ownership history.

5. Average selling price by seller type:
   - It shows that, the selling price of the cars depend on the type of seller i.e., the average selling price of the cars is higher if the seller type is Dealer and this tells the customer for choosing the seller type.

## Insights:

- Sales Fluctuations: The total number of cars sold each year offers a window into market health, with potential insights into how external factors affect consumer purchasing decisions.
- Market Segmentation by Fuel Type: The data suggests distinct market segments based on fuel types. Diesel cars dominate in higher price brackets and longer journeys, while CNG and LPG vehicles cater to more economical and potentially urban-focused markets.
- Ownership Patterns: The number of owners for each vehicle can indicate its resale value and desirability in the second-hand market. Diesel and petrol vehicles with multiple owners suggest ongoing demand and reliability.

## Conclusion:

The dashboard presents a detailed overview of car sales trends, with a focus on how various factors such as brand, year, fuel type, and ownership history influence market dynamics. It could be a useful tool for identifying key market trends, understanding consumer behavior, and making data-driven decisions in the automotive industry.
